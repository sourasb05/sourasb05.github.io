Welcome to my corner of the web!

I am a **Doctoral (Ph.D) Student** in Federated learning at [Ume책 University](https://www.umu.se/en/) ([Autonomous Distributed System Lab](https://www.umu.se/en/research/groups/autonomous-distributed-systems-lab/), [Department of Computer Science](https://www.umu.se/en/department-of-computing-science/)). My Ph.D is funded by [WASP](https://wasp-sweden.org/).

I am a member of the [IEEE](https://students.ieee.org/), [IEEE CIS](https://cis.ieee.org/), [ACM](https://www.acm.org/membership/membership-options), [APNNS](https://www.apnns.org/)
