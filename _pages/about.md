Welcome to my corner of the web!

I am a **Doctoral (Ph.D) Student** in Federated learning in [Department of Computer Science](https://www.umu.se/en/department-of-computing-science/) at [Ume책 University](https://www.umu.se/en/). My supervisors are [Dr. Monowar Bhuyan](https://people.cs.umu.se/monowar/index.html) and [Prof. Erik Elmroth](https://people.cs.umu.se/elmroth/index.html). Also, I am a member of [Autonomous Distributed Systems Lab](https://www.umu.se/en/research/groups/autonomous-distributed-systems-lab/). My PhD is in collaboration and funded by Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program([WASP](https://wasp-sweden.org/)).

Before that, I obtained M.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering in 2018 from [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.caluniv.ac.in/academic/Compsc.html), [University of Calcutta](http://www.caluniv.ac.in/), Kolkata, India  under the supervision of [Prof. Nabendu Chaki]([http://www.lsta.upmc.fr/biau.html](https://research.caluniv.ac.in/researcher/nabendu-chaki)). Prior to that, I obtained M.Sc in Computer and Information Science in 2016 from Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Calcutta, Kolkata, India . Also, I obtained Bachelor of Computer Science (Honours) in 2014 from [St.Xavier's College (Autonomous)](https://www.sxccal.edu/b-sc-computer-science-department/), Kolkata, India.

I am a member of the [IEEE](https://students.ieee.org/), [IEEE CIS](https://cis.ieee.org/), [ACM](https://www.acm.org/membership/membership-options), [APNNS](https://www.apnns.org/)
