Welcome to my corner of the web!

I am a **Doctoral (Ph.D) Student** in Federated learning at [Umeå University](https://www.umu.se/en/) ([Autonomous Distributed System Lab](https://www.umu.se/en/research/groups/autonomous-distributed-systems-lab/), [Department of Computer Science](https://www.umu.se/en/department-of-computing-science/)). My Ph.D is funded by ([WASP](https://wasp-sweden.org/)).

I am a member of the [IEE](),[ACM](), [APNNS]()

<!-- I obtained a Ph.D. in mathematics in 2013 from [UPMC](http://www.upmc.fr/) (Université Pierre & Marie Curie, France) under the supervision of [Gérard Biau](http://www.lsta.upmc.fr/biau.html) and [Éric Moulines](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=_XE1LvQAAAAJ&hl=fr). Prior to that, I was a research assistant at [DTU Compute](http://www.compute.dtu.dk/) (Denmark) supervised by [Gilles Guillot](http://www2.imm.dtu.dk/~gigu/#).
 -->

<!-- My main line of research is in statistical machine learning. I am primarily interested in the design, analysis and implementation of statistical learning methods for high dimensional problems. My interests include (but are not limited to): PAC-Bayesian theory, sparsity and high-dimensional statistics, optimisation theory, statistical learning theory, non-negative matrix factorisation, aggregation of estimators and classifiers, MCMC algorithms, (un)supervised learning, online clustering, concentration inequalities... -->
